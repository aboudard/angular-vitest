# Angular Vitest

Basic Angular Vitest project.
The purpose is to run tests with Vitest, thanks to [AnalogJs plugin](https://analogjs.org/docs/features/testing/vitest).

Github Actions are used to run tests on each push.
Force install is used to install dependencies since there are some version conflicts.
